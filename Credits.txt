Alternative Civilizations

A collection of what-ifs civilzations documented through some novels
written by unfamous or famous authors.

Conditions for inclusion of fictional civilizations: 
1. This civilization must last in record at least 100 years.
2. This civilization must have at least one famous leader. If there
are many, only choose the best. If there's none, choose the founder.
3. This civilization must have a unique personality that is different
from the real-life civilizations. If such a civilization does extend 
from the real-life examples, stretch it further. Make hypothesis
about its future reforms. Quoting the Philippine intellectual and 
hero Jose Rizal, "a nation's future can be predicted by its past and present".
There are many ways a nation can undergo changes. The creativity is the limit!
